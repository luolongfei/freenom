### 📢 Notice

- This project was banned because of the GitHub Action incident before, and then I briefly transferred the project to https://github.com/luolongfei/next-freenom
  Warehouse, and then under the reminder of [@Matraks](https://github.com/Matraks), restored this warehouse in a special way.
- The direct consequence of this ban is that all previous `issues` are lost, and the number of `star` of nearly `1.8k` returns to zero. The motivation is indeed affected, but it will not have much impact. The project is still maintained for a long time, if the project helps you, welcome to star.
- Three Caves of the Rabbit, the temporary warehouse https://github.com/luolongfei/next-freenom is also a backup warehouse. If this warehouse loses contact again, you can move to the backup warehouse to get the latest news. Under normal circumstances, future development and maintenance will still be in this warehouse conduct.
- Recommended [🐳 Deploy via Docker](#-deploy via-docker-). If you don't have your own server, you can refer to this document [📦 Deploying via Koyeb](#-via-Koyeb-deploying).
- Enthusiastic users have created the `Freenom Renewal Affairs Bureau` group, which can be used for communication, testing, and feedback. **Join directly by visiting [https://t.me/freenom_auto_renew](https://t.me/freenom_auto_renew ), or scan the QR code to join: **

### 📃 Introduction

As we all know, Freenom is the only merchant on the planet that provides free top-level domain names, but it needs to be renewed every year, and each renewal is up to one year. Since I applied for a bunch of domain names, and I did not apply at the same time, each renewal felt frustrating, so I wrote this automatic renewal script.

### 🍭 Effect

Regardless of the success or failure of the renewal or an error in the execution of the program, you will receive a notification from the script. If it is a notification related to the success or failure of the renewal, the notification will include the expiration days of the non-renewed domain name, etc. *Here is the content of the notification email. *

<a href="https://s4.ax1x.com/2022/02/26/bZr7WQ.png"><img src="https://s4.ax1x.com/2022/02/26/bZr7WQ.png" alt="邮件示例" border="0" width="95%" height="100%" /></a>

### 🎁 Prepare beforehand

- VPS: Any server is fine, the system recommends `Debian`. The `PHP` version needs to be `php7.3` and above. If you have a `Docker` environment, you can ignore this restriction. If you do not have a server, you can refer to this document to deploy in various free environments.
- Delivery mailbox (optional): For the convenience of understanding, it is also called robot mailbox, which is used to send notification emails. Currently for `Gmail`, `QQ mailbox`, `163 mailbox` and `Outlook mailbox`, the program will automatically determine the sending mailbox type and use the appropriate configuration.
  If you are using other third-party email or self-built email service, please refer to [.env.example](https://github.com/luolongfei/freenom/blob/main/.env.example)
  Comments related to mail configuration in the file are configured.
- Receiving mailbox (optional): used to receive notification emails from the robot.
- The above `Sending Mailbox` and `Receiving Mailbox` are optional, because the current program already supports `Email Send` / `Telegram Bot` / `Enterprise WeChat` / `Server Sauce` / `Bark` and other sending methods, only When you use `Send Mail`, `Sending Mailbox` and `Receive Mailbox`
  It is necessary. For other sending methods, please refer to the following [Configure Sending Function](#-Configuring Sending Function).
- Patience.

### 📪 Configure the sending function

Here we will introduce the configuration methods of `Mail Delivery` / `Telegram Bot` / `Enterprise WeChat` / `Server Sauce` / `Bark` respectively, as well as the required information. You can choose one of the delivery methods. Configuration, just jump to the corresponding document to view it. If you are IOS
users, recommend using `Bark`
For the delivery method, users of other platforms can choose an acceptable delivery method according to their own preferences. It is not recommended to use `Server Sauce` to send letters, `Server Sauce` has a daily limit on the number of letters sent, and you need to be a member to directly see the content of the mail, otherwise you need to skip to `Server Sauce`
The website can only view the content, which is not recommended. The same configuration can directly use the `Enterprise WeChat` mail delivery method, and the `Enterprise WeChat' sender can see the content of the letter directly on the ordinary WeChat client.

#### Mail delivery
The following introduces the settings of `Gmail`, `QQ mailbox` and `163 mailbox`, you only need to look at the parts you need. Note that `QQ Mailbox` and `163 Mailbox` both use the method of `account plus authorization code` to log in.
Please note that `Google Mail` uses `account plus password` or `account plus authorization code` to log in. In addition, I would like to complain that you have to spend a dime to send a text message to the mailbox provider to get the authorization code for domestic mailboxes.

*It is recommended to open the privacy mode of the browser and then log in to gmail to set it up, so as to prevent you from being unable to jump to the correct setting address when you have multiple gmail accounts. *

1. In `Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP`, check the

- Enable POP for all mail
- enable IMAP

![gmail configuration 01](https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/31/13tKsg.png "gmail configuration 01")

Then save the changes.

2. Turn on two-step verification

Refer to the official document: [Enable two-step verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839)

3. Configure the application-specific password to log in to the mailbox

Refer to the official document: [Login with application-specific password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en)

**Because Gmail no longer supports "insecure login methods", currently you can only log in with an account plus an application-specific password. **

Now click `Client Authorization Password` on the sidebar and get the authorization code. The screen you see may be different from mine, because I have already obtained the authorization code, so there is only the `Reset Authorization Code` button. Here I am according to the website Prompt to apply for an authorization code. Netease is as disgusting as Tencent. You need to send a text message to it with your mobile phone to get the authorization code.

![163 Mailbox Configuration 03](https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/31/13WMaq.png "163 Mailbox Configuration 03")

After the 163 mailbox is sent, if the recipient does not receive it, you can look it up in the spam.

After the above actions are completed, in the `.env` file, set `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` to your mailbox and password (or token), set `TO` to your mailbox, and then ` The value of MAIL_ENABLE` is set to `1` to enable mailbox delivery.

The above describes three ways to set up mailboxes. If you don’t want to use mail delivery, change the value of `MAIL_ENABLE` in the `.env` file in the root directory to `0` to turn off the mail push method.

***

*End of the chapter related to configuring the sending function. Let's talk about several ways to use this project. It is recommended to use the Docker method without worrying about the environment. *

***

### 🐳 Deploy via Docker

*This is the most recommended way to deploy if you have your own server. *

The address of the Docker warehouse is: [https://hub.docker.com/r/luolongfei/freenom](https://hub.docker.com/r/luolongfei/freenom), welcome to star too.
The supported architectures of this image are `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`, `linux/386`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm/v6`, theoretically supports `Synology`
, `QNAP`, `Raspberry Pi` and various types of `VPS`.

#### 1. Install Docker

##### 1.1 Log in as the root user and execute a one-click script to install Docker

Upgrade the source and install the software (choose one of the following two commands, according to your own system)

Debian / Ubuntu

```shell
apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget vim
```

CentOS

```shell
yum update && yum install -y wget vim
```

Execute this command and wait for Docker to be installed automatically

```shell
wget -qO- get.docker.com | bash
```

Note: Please use the VPS of KVM architecture, the VPS of OpenVZ architecture does not support Docker installation, and CentOS 8 does not support using this script to install Docker. More about Docker
The content of the installation refers to [Docker Official Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 。

##### 1.2 Execute the following command against Docker

Start the Docker service

```shell
systemctl start docker
```

View Docker running status

```shell
systemctl status docker
```

Add the Docker service to start automatically at boot

```shell
systemctl enable docker
```

#### 2. Deploy the domain name renewal script through Docker

##### 2.1 Create and start a container with Docker

The command is as follows

```shell
docker run -d --name freenom --restart always -v $(pwd):/conf -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs luolongfei/freenom
```

Or, if you want to customize the script execution time, the command is as follows

```shell
docker run -d --name freenom --restart always -v $(pwd):/conf -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs -e RUN_AT="11:24" luolongfei/freenom
```

The above command is only one more than the previous command `-e RUN_AT="11:24"`, where `11:24` means that the renewal task will be executed at 11:24 Beijing time every day, you can customize this time. The `RUN_AT` parameter here also supports CRON
The time format in the command, for example, `-e RUN_AT="9 11 * * *"`, means that the renewal task will be executed at 11:09 Beijing time every day. If you don’t want to execute the task every day, but only want to execute it every few days, just use Just modify the value of `RUN_AT`.

**Note: Custom script execution time is not recommended. Because you may define the same time point with many people, this may cause everyone to initiate a request to Freenom's server at the same time, making Freenom unable to provide stable services. And if you do not customize the time, the program will automatically specify Beijing time 06 ~
A random time point at 23:00 is used as the execution time, and it will be automatically re-specified every time the container is restarted. **

    <summary>Click me to view the parameter explanation of the above Docker command</summary>
<br>

| command | meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| docker run | start running a container |
| -d parameter | run the container in the background and output the container ID |
| --name parameter | Assign an identifier to the container for future start, stop, delete and other operations |
| --restart parameter | Configure the container startup type, always means that the container will be automatically started when the docker service is restarted |
| -v parameter| Mount the volume (volume), after the colon is the path of the container, before the colon is the path of the host (only absolute paths are supported), `$(pwd)` indicates the current directory, if it is a Windows system, it can be used `${PWD}` replaces `$(pwd)` here |
| -e parameter | Specify the environment variable in the container |
| luolongfei/freenom | This is the full path name of the image downloaded from docker hub |

</details>

At this point, your auto-renewal container is running. After executing `ls -a`, you can see that in your current directory, there is a `.env` file and a `logs` directory, `logs` directory The program log is stored in it, and `.env` is the configuration file, now execute `vim .env` directly
Change all the configuration items in the `.env` file to your own and save it. Then restart the container, and if the configuration is correct, you will receive relevant emails soon.

> How to verify that your configuration is correct?
>

After modifying and saving the `.env` file, execute `docker restart freenom` to restart the container, wait for about 5 seconds, and then execute `docker logs freenom` to view the output content, and observe that there is `execution successful` in the output content
, it means the configuration is correct. If you do not have time to configure the sending mailbox and other content, you can disable the mail function first.

> How to upgrade to the latest version or redeploy?
>

In the directory where `.env` is located, execute `docker rm -f freenom` to delete the existing container, and then execute `docker rmi -f luolongfei/freenom`
Delete the old image, and then execute the above `docker run -d --name freenom --restart always -v $(pwd):/conf -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs luolongfei/freenom`
Just redeploy, so that the latest code will be available after deployment. Of course, the `.env` file corresponding to the new version may change, don’t worry, the program will automatically update the contents of the `.env` file and migrate the existing configuration to it.

One-sentence operation, that is, execute the following command in the directory where the `.env` file is located to complete the update and upgrade:

```shell
docker rm -f freenom && docker rmi -f luolongfei/freenom && docker run -d --name freenom --restart always -v $(pwd):/conf -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs luolongfei/freenom
```

##### 2.2 Post-container management and common commands of Docker

View the online status and size of the container

```shell
docker ps -as
```

View the running output log of the container

```shell

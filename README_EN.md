### üìÉ Why write this script

As we all know, Freenom is the only merchant on the planet that provides free top-level domain names, but it needs to be
renewed every year for up to one year at a time. Since I applied for a bunch of domain names, and not at the same time,
So I felt frustrated every time I renewed, so I wrote this automatic renewal script.

### üåø Special Thanks

Thanks for non-commercial open source development authorization by JetBrains.

### üç≠ Demo

Whether the renewal is successful or unsuccessful or the script executes with an error, you will receive a notification from the script. In case of renewal success or failure related notifications, the notification will include the number of days to expiration for the unrenewed domain name, etc. *The content of the notification email is shown here.*

### üéÅ Preparation

- Email of robot: Used to send notification emails.
- Your email: Used to receive notification emails sent by robots.
- VPS: Any server can be used. The system recommends `Debian`, and the PHP version must be` php7.3` or above.
- No more

### üì™ Setting up Gmail

*It is recommended to open the privacy mode of your browser and then log in to gmail to set up the settings, to prevent you from not being able to jump to the correct settings URL when you have multiple gmail accounts.*

1.In `Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP`, tick

- Enable POP for all messages
- Enable IMAP

![gmail Configuration 01](https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/02/01/1GDsMR.png "gmail Configuration 01")

Then save your changes.

2.Enable two-step verification

Refer to the official document: [Turn on 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en)

3.Configure login with application-specific password

Refer to the official document: [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en)

**Because Gmail no longer supports "insecure login", you can only use the account plus application-specific password to
login now.**

After the above operation is finished, set `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` to your mailbox and application-specific
password in `.env` file, set `TO` to your incoming mailbox, and then set the value of `MAIL_ENABLE` to `1` to enable the
mailbox delivery function.

If you don't want to use email related features, change the value of `MAIL_ENABLE` in the `.env` file in the root
directory to `0` to turn off the email push method.

### ü§∂ Telegram bot

If you don't want to use email push, you can also use Telegram bot. In the `.env` file, Change the value
of `TELEGRAM_BOT_ENABLE` to `1` to enable the Telegram bot. Similarly, change the value of `MAIL_ENABLE` to `0` to
disable the mail push method. Telegram bot has two configuration items, one is `chat_id` (corresponding
to `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env` file), You can get your own id by sending `/start` to `@userinfobot` using your Telegram
account, The other is `token` (corresponding to `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in the `.env` file), your Telegram bot token, how
to create a Telegram bot and how to get the token please refer to:
[Official Document](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

**The next step is to start describing how to deploy this script, there are two ways to deploy it, one is to pull the
code and deploy it directly, the other is to deploy it via docker. We recommend deploying via docker, it's easy and
hassle-free.**

### üê≥ Deployment via docker

**Deployment via docker is our recommended deployment method. For detailed deployment steps, please
visit: [https://hub.docker.com/r/luolongfei/freenom](https://hub.docker.com/r/luolongfei/freenom)**

There is a detailed description in the docker repository documentation, and the whole deployment process is quite
simple.

<hr>

### üß± Direct pull code deployment

*We don't recommend this deployment method as it requires certain environment requirements to be met for direct code
pull deployment.*

#### üöß Configuration script

All operations are performed under Centos7 system, other Linux distributions are similar

##### Get the source code

```bash
$ mkdir -p /data/wwwroot/freenom
$ cd /data/wwwroot/freenom

# clone the repository source
$ git clone https://github.com/luolongfei/freenom.git ./
```

##### Configuration process

```bash
# Copy configuration file template
$ cp .env.example .env

# Edit configuration file
$ vim .env

# .env Each item in the file has a detailed description, which will not be repeated here. In short, you need to change all the items in it to your own. Note the format of the multi-account configuration:
# e.g. MULTIPLE_ACCOUNTS='<account1>@<password1>|<account2>@<password2>|<account3>@<password3>'
# Of course, if you only have a single account, you only need to configure FREEENOM_USERNAME and FREEENOM_PASSWORD. The configurations of single account and multiple accounts will be read together and duplicated.

# After editing, press "Esc" to return to the command mode, enter ":wq" and press Enter to save and exit. If you don't use vim editor, you can ask Uncle Google. :)
```

#### üéà Add scheduled task

##### Install crontabs and cronie

```bash
$ yum -y install cronie crontabs

# Verify if crond is installed and started
$ yum list cronie && systemctl status crond

# Verify that crontab is installed
$ yum list crontabs $$ which crontab && crontab -l
```

##### Open the task form and edit

```bash
$ crontab -e

# Task content is as follows
# The meaning of this task is to execute the run file under /data/wwwroot/freenom/ at 9 AM every day
# Note: In some cases, crontab may not find your php path. The following command will output an error message in the freenom_crontab.log file. You should specify the php path: replace the following php with /usr/local/php/bin/php (based on the actual situation)
00 09 * * * cd /data/wwwroot/freenom/ && php run > freenom_crontab.log 2>&1
```

##### Restart the crond daemon (This step is required each time you edit the task form for the task to take effect)

```bash
$ systemctl restart crond
```

To check if the `Task` is normal, you can set the execution time of the above task to a few minutes, and then wait until
the task execution is completed, check the contents of the `freenom_crontab.log` file in the `/data/wwwroot/freenom/`
directory for errors. Common error messages are as follows:

- /bin/sh: php: command not found
- /bin/sh: /usr/local/php: Is a directory

>

</details>

Of course, if your `crontab` can correctly find the `php path` without error, you don't need to do anything.

*So far, all the configurations have been completed, let's verify if the whole process works* :)

#### ‚òï Verification

You can first change the value of `NOTICE_FREQ` in `.env` to 1 (Push notification every time the script is executed),
and then execute

```bash
$ cd /data/wwwroot/freenom/ && php run
```

If nothing else, you will receive an email about the domain name.
